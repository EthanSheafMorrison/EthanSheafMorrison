# Empty Vessels

## Summary

An installation exploring the interplay between form and void, emphasizing the spatial dynamics of emptiness. The project considers how negative space can act as a container for thought, memory, and presence.

## Process

### Conceptual Starting Point

The idea began with a simple question: _what do we notice when there is nothing?_ This provocation led to material experiments in volume, shadow, and resonance.

<h3>Design Inquiry</h3>
<p>Can we design around absence, rather than presence?</p>

### Material Exploration

Clay vessels, 3D-printed voids, and plaster moulds were all tested for their ability to evoke presence through absence. Each piece acted as a silent amplifier of surrounding space.
