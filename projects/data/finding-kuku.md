## Project Overview

Finding Kuku is a photographic mapping project that explores the reconnection of whakapapa (genealogy and cultural identity) through visual storytelling. This project documents my journey to trace family connections across landscapes that hold cultural significance.

## Background

My connection to my ancestral lands has been fragmented through generations of displacement and cultural disconnection. This project began as a personal exploration to visually document and reconnect with places that are significant to my family history.

## Process

The process involved several interconnected approaches:

1. **Historical Research**: Gathering family stories, historical documents, and archival photographs
2. **Field Photography**: Visiting significant locations and documenting them through a contemporary lens
3. **Mapping**: Creating visual connections between places, memories, and family narratives
4. **Cultural Consultation**: Working with elders and knowledge-keepers to ensure cultural protocols were respected

## Visual Approach

The photographic style balances documentary and artistic approaches. I used a combination of:

- Landscape photography to capture the physical environment
- Detail shots that focus on cultural markers and evidence of human presence
- Portraits of family members in significant locations
- Archival images juxtaposed with contemporary photographs

## Technical Details

The project was shot using:

- Medium format film camera for landscape work
- Digital photography for documentary elements
- Analog photographic processes for select prints
- GPS mapping to create accurate location data

## Exhibition

The Finding Kuku project culminated in an exhibition that featured:

- Large-scale photographic prints
- An interactive mapping component that allowed visitors to trace connections
- Audio recordings of family stories and cultural context
- A physical installation representing the journey of reconnection

## Significance

This project represents more than just a photographic body of work. It serves as:

- A personal journey of cultural reconnection
- A document of places and stories that might otherwise be lost
- A contribution to broader conversations about indigenous identity and place
- A template for others seeking to reconnect with their cultural heritage through visual means

## Ongoing Work

Finding Kuku continues to evolve as an ongoing project. Future directions include:

- Expanding the geographic scope to include additional significant sites
- Developing a digital archive accessible to family members
- Publishing a book that combines images, maps, and family narratives
- Conducting workshops to help others document their own cultural connections

## Acknowledgments

This project would not have been possible without the generous support and guidance of family elders, cultural advisors, and community members who shared their knowledge and stories.
