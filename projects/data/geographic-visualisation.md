# Geographic Visualisation

## Summary

This project investigates methods of visualising geographic data to uncover patterns in climate, land use, and human geography. It blends cartographic design with data storytelling.

---

## Process

### Research & Data

The visualisation was developed using public datasets related to sea level rise, regional demographics, and land zoning overlays.

### Visual Language

Each dataset was processed to highlight not just facts, but relationships. The aim was to translate raw data into legible, interpretable visuals that resonate across disciplines.
