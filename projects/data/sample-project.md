## About This Template

This is a sample project page that demonstrates how to use markdown to create detailed project documentation. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write formatted content using a plain-text editor.

## Benefits of Using Markdown

- **Simplicity**: Easy to learn and use without complex formatting tools
- **Portability**: Works across platforms and can be converted to many formats
- **Version Control**: Plain text files work well with version control systems
- **Separation of Content and Design**: Focus on writing without worrying about layout

## How to Use This Template

To create a new project page using this template:

1. Create a markdown file in the `projects/data/` directory
2. Name the file using the same ID as in your `data.json` entry
3. Add front matter at the top of the file (the section between `---` markers)
4. Write your project content using markdown syntax
5. The system will automatically render your content on the project page

## Markdown Features

You can use various markdown features to enhance your project documentation:

### Headers

Use `#` symbols to create headers of different levels.

### Lists

Create bulleted lists with `-` or `*` and numbered lists with `1.`, `2.`, etc.

### Emphasis

Make text **bold** with double asterisks or _italic_ with underscores.

### Links

Create [links to external resources](https://example.com) or to other pages on your site.

### Code Blocks

```javascript
// Show code examples
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

### Images

You can reference images in your markdown, but they'll be handled by the gallery system in the project page.

## Conclusion

Using this markdown-based project system allows you to focus on documenting your projects without worrying about HTML structure. It maintains a consistent design across all your project pages while giving you the flexibility to add detailed content for each project.
