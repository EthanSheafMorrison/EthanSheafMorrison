# Iterate Postgraduate Showcase

## Summary

A showcase of innovative design research and practice from postgraduate students across multiple disciplines. This project involved the curation, design, and spatial configuration of a collaborative exhibition hosted at Victoria University of Wellington’s Te Aro campus.

## Process

### Curation & Planning

The initial stages involved group brainstorming and the development of a curatorial framework that could accommodate a wide range of individual postgraduate projects. We wanted the exhibition to feel cohesive, yet allow enough space for each student to present their research on its own terms.

<h3>Design Question</h3>
<p>How can a collective showcase reflect individual inquiry while maintaining a unified curatorial vision?</p>
</highlight-box>

### Design Language

We opted for a minimal yet modular visual system. Graphic materials included print collateral, signage, exhibition guides, and a digital presence. The grid-based design system allowed for responsive scaling across formats.

### Collaboration

Working alongside fellow students, technicians, and faculty advisors, we developed a physical layout that encouraged visitors to flow naturally through the space. Each student installed their own work, but within a shared spatial rhythm. The result was a layered experience of design dialogue.

## Tools & Techniques

- Modular grid design
- Large-format digital printing
- Laser-cut wayfinding signage
- Spatial prototyping with SketchUp

## Installation Design

The exhibition layout responded to both architectural constraints and accessibility concerns. Modular structures were used to partition space while still allowing open sight lines across the gallery floor.

## Prototyping & Testing

Before final install, we created a scaled mockup of the display using cardboard cutouts and foamcore print tests to ensure proper flow and legibility.

<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>The exhibition was designed with wheelchair-friendly flow and braille guides at key locations.</p>

## Reflection

The process of shaping something collectively — through discussion, compromise, and iteration — became a metaphor for the work itself. It was less about showing finished pieces and more about offering entry points into ongoing practices.
