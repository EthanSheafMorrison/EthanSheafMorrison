## Background

Western Sahara Resource Watch (WSRW) is an international organization working to highlight the exploitation of resources in the occupied territory of Western Sahara. The project involved redesigning their website to better communicate their mission and research while making it more accessible to a global audience.

## Challenge

The main challenges for this project were:

- Creating a responsive design that works across all devices
- Organizing a large amount of research data in an accessible format
- Implementing a multilingual system for content in several languages
- Integrating interactive data visualizations for complex datasets

## Process

The project began with a thorough audit of the existing website and understanding the organization's needs. I conducted stakeholder interviews to identify key requirements and pain points with the current site.

The design process followed these key stages:

1. **Research & Planning**: Understanding WSRW's work, audience, and content needs
2. **Information Architecture**: Restructuring content for better accessibility and user flow
3. **Wireframing**: Creating low-fidelity layouts for key page templates
4. **UI Design**: Developing a clean, professional visual language that emphasized clarity
5. **Prototyping**: Building interactive prototypes for user testing
6. **Development**: Implementing the final design as a responsive website

## Development

The site was built using a combination of:

- HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for frontend
- Markdown-based content management for easy updates
- Custom data visualization components for research data
- Responsive image handling for optimal performance across devices

A key feature was the implementation of a tagging system that allowed visitors to easily find related content across different sections of the site.

## Outcome

The redesigned website launched in May 2023 and has resulted in:

- 43% increase in average session duration
- 27% reduction in bounce rate
- Improved accessibility scores
- Better mobile engagement metrics
- Positive feedback from stakeholders and users

The project successfully transformed a content-heavy research site into an engaging platform that effectively communicates WSRW's important work while making the information more accessible to journalists, researchers, and the general public.
