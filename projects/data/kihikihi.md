## Historical Context

Kihikihi has a rich history that dates back to pre-European settlement. The area was an important site during the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s, and today stands as a testament to both colonial history and Māori resilience.

Key historical events include:

1. **Pre-European Settlement**: A significant Māori settlement with strategic importance
2. **Land Wars Period**: Site of major confrontations during the New Zealand Wars
3. **Colonial Development**: Transformation into a European settlement
4. **Modern Revival**: Contemporary efforts to acknowledge and preserve local heritage
